      # Public: Trace a given block of code. Detect any exceptions thrown by
      # the block and report errors.
      #
      # layer - The layer the block of code belongs to.
      # opts - A hash containing key/value pairs that will be reported along
      # with the first event of this layer (optional).
      # protect_op - specify the operating being traced.  Used to avoid
      # double tracing between operations that call each other
      #
      # Example
      #
      #   def computation(n)
      #     fib(n)

      #   result = computation_with_oboe(1000)

      # Returns the result of the block.
